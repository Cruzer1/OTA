✳️✳️First and foremost Hello everyone / almost been a month since my last update on the changelog, neverthless, we've had many exciting things happpenenig this time, like lets say Android Q oops Android 10 I mean, google's re-done may things there but that's for another day.✳️✳️

⭕Most probably due to which(I'm assuming we don't have a sept pactch yet)

⭕There are backports of lineage available on the patch, but I inisisted we wait this month and if Google plans to discontinue pie(Which i'm hoping it doesn't), We'll look for alternatives.

⭕Apart from that change is not an easy thing. As much excited as many people are regarding Q, I'm pretty sure that for some time (a couple of months) people would want a stable rom to come back to until they can feel homely with Q, and we plan on delivering it, we'll keep updating pie, and in bg keep refining android 10 source and releae the first 10 build in a complete manner....
