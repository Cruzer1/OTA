Changelog
Team Stag September 14, 2020

Well Hello there half way into September, and well we're sorry we kept you all waiting.

We have the September patch merged and a version uprev to 10.0.6.
With all the uproar on 11, it's still to early to have a stable daily driver 11, so we want you all to use a version of stag that once you flash you feel like staying more than like testing, Hence our 11 updates will come a bit later, and 10 will still be supported.
And a major requested feature FaceUnlock makes a comeback.

So Let's Go with changelog:
